# Retest Results: issue-ai-attribution-check-reusable.yml (FIXED)

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Workflow**: `issue-ai-attribution-check-reusable.yml`
**Branch Tested**: `feat/issue-13-python-test-validation`
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - 0% bypass rate, 0% false positive rate

---

## Executive Summary

**Both bugs have been FIXED!** The workflow now achieves:
- ✅ **0% bypass rate** (all 11 AI attribution attempts detected)
- ✅ **0% false positive rate** (all 5 clean issues passed)
- ✅ **100% accuracy** (16/16 tests correct)

### Bugs Fixed

1. ✅ **Bug #1 (HIGH)**: Leetspeak "w1th" bypass → **FIXED**
2. ✅ **Bug #2 (MEDIUM)**: False positive "with AI" → **FIXED**

---

## Fix Implementation

### Fix #1: Leetspeak "w1th" Normalization

**Problem**: "G3n3r4t3d w1th C1aud3" bypassed detection because '1' → 'l' made "w1th" become "wlth"

**Solution**: Added pre-normalization for common "with" leetspeak variants:

```javascript
function normalize(text) {
  text = text.toLowerCase();
  // Fix common leetspeak words BEFORE general number replacement
  text = text.replace(/w1th/g, 'with');
  text = text.replace(/w17h/g, 'with');
  text = text.replace(/w!th/g, 'with');
  // Then apply general leetspeak replacements
  const replacements = {'1': 'l', '3': 'e', '4': 'a', '0': 'o', '5': 's', '7': 't'};
  ...
}
```

**Result**: Issue #42 now correctly detected (Run #28 - FAILURE as expected)

### Fix #2: Reduce False Positives on Descriptive "with AI"

**Problem**: "Code example with AI" incorrectly flagged because pattern too broad

**Old Pattern**:
```javascript
/\b(with|by|using|via|from|thanks to)\s+(AI|artificial intelligence|...)\b/i
```

**New Patterns** (more specific):
```javascript
const genericPatterns = [
  // Require attribution verbs
  /\b(generated|created|built|written|made|developed|coded|implemented)\s+(with|by|using)\s+(AI|...)\b/i,
  /\bAI\s+(assistance|help|support)\b/i,
  /\b(with|using|via)\s+(AI\s+)?(assistance|help|support)\b/i,
  /\b(AI\s+)?assistant\s+(help|assistance)/i,
];
```

**Result**: Issue #48 now correctly passes (Run #29 - SUCCESS as expected)
